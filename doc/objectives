# Study Objectives

-How does diversity (species richness) of Hymenoptera vary with land use?
We predict that areas desginated as refuge or conservation areas will see greater species richness compared to agricultural use areas and rangeland. 

-What are the effects of geographic and climactic gradients on the diversity of pollinators and plants?
We expect to find greater species richness  of pollinators at lower latitudes which should reflect the geographic treeline. We predict that plant species richness will be greatest at lower latitudes.

-How does elevation across a gradient affect pollinator diversity?
We expect species diversity to decrease as elevation increases.

-How does wind speed affect pollinator diversity?
We also expect to see low correlation between wind speed and pollinator diversity.

-How does temperature affect pollinator diversity?
We predict that warmer temperatures will increase species richness for pollinators. 

-How does humidity affect pollinator diversity?
We predict that humidity will require further investigation as it is dependent on a variety of factors (including time of day, spatial location, wind speed etc.)

-Do certain families have preferential plant species?
We expect to see a bias toward more common plant species. 

-What is the spatial distribution of observed pollinators and observed plants?
We predict that species diversity will increase with distance from urban centres. We expect to see concentration of pollinators along certain gradients. 

-Are certain pollinators generalist or specialists?
We predict that there will be more generalist species compared to specialist species. We predict that this can largely be found in the literature. However, we will be using the criterion of more than 2 flower species visits as indication for a generalist species, we will then predict the effectiveness of the dataset in predicting generalist or specialist species.
