# Possible analyses
Data cleaning:
- filter out data so that we only have values of the largest sampled pollinator families/orders. ( excluding sp due to lack of information)
- remove N/As in the pollinator family/genus column
- change all column names to R appropriate names
- convert all variables to factors

Statistical tests:
- Anova to test difference between Land-use and pollinator diversity/distribution
- models to test relationships between biological, geographical, and environmental and pollinator diversity, distribution, and relationship with associated plants diveristy, and distribution
- Spatial stats on the distribution of pollinator and assiciated plants-

# Possible results table
- model dscribing the relationship between pollinator and associated plant diversity 
- model describing the relationship between pollinator distribution and associated plant distribution (spatial stats)
- model describing how geographical and environmental gradients account for pollinator distribution 
-(while including random effects of sampler, covariation of the sampling day/time for climactic information)

# Possible results figues
- distribution of pollinators and distribution of associated plants (map). Can also overlay the major cities in the area to see how pollinators are distributed across human populations
- distribution of pollinators across the Significant enviornmental and geographic gradients (elevation, temp, windspeed, etc) [geom_point]
- hist of landuse and pollinator observations
- spatial map of landuse and pollinator observations/diversity/richness
