Here we will be uploading our mock plots.

Natasha:

- Largest families (greater than 50 occurrences) are Andrenidae, Apidae, and Halictidae. Of those families, the largest genera (greater than 20 occurrences) are Apis, Bombus, Lassioglossum, Melissodes, Perdita. Of those genera, the associated plant families with most occurrences (greater than 50) are Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lytheraceae, Polygonaceae.
- State occurrence data ranked from most abundant to least abundant: North Dakota > Texas > Colorado.
- Plot of Hymenoptera observations in the United States coloured by Family

**We have a more than 800 observations after everything is filtered (NA's, only genera with greater than 20 observations, only associated plant species with over 50 observations). 

Sophia:

- At constant latitude, 3 graphs on how a) wind speed b) air temperature c) relative air humidity vary on an elevational gradient.
- At constant elevation, 3 graphs on how a) wind speed b) air temperature c) relative air humidity vary on a latitudinal gradient.

- At constant latitude, distribution of hymenopteran genera across an elevational gradient with air temperature on the y-axis.
- At constant elevation, distribution of hymenopteran genera across a latitudinal gradient with air temperature on the y-axis.

**One has more genera than another because of an unequal number of NA's present in the dataset for each genus' latitude and elevation columns

Madison:

-The basic plot provides an overview of the all orders and includes a count of observations across land usage categories. 
- Abundance of Hymenoptera families across land usage categories. We predict that species richness will be greatest on Conservation Reserve areas and Nature Wildlife Refuge areas. 
**The original dataset was modified to remove NAs and filter our Hymenoptera in the second plot.
