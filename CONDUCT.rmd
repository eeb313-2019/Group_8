CODE OF CONDUCT

1) GitHub etiquette
- Fork and work in your own repo, then generate a pull request to merge with main repo
- Be detailed in your descriptions in edits and pull requests
- To approve Pull Requests, the first person who approves it will react to it and the second person who approves it will merge
- Tag people in pull requests so teammates know to check and approve it - let each other know if a pull request is l i n g e r i n g
- Issues tab: start discussions, ask questions, problems. Flagged based on type of problem
- Different stats code should be in different files - e.g. spatial stats should be different file than models
- Projects tab: to-do cards —> move over to in-progress and done. Use this to track individual progress. Use to assign tasks

2) Logistics
- Meet twice a week during class time
- Assign tasks during one of these meetings - don’t be afraid to ask questions and get help
- Deadlines are HARD DEADLINES. Please ask all questions and get help before this deadline, do not leave for last second
- Use Facebook Messenger to communicate about progress/questions/concerns, meeting times, etc. as we can't always be checking GitHub all the time!
- We will rotate leader/recorder/organizer roles at each meeting

3) Behaviour and regulation
